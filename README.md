# 0-1-Knapsack-Problem
Python implementation of solving the 0-1 Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming. The algorithm breaks the problem down into subproblems using a recursive divide and cocour technique and uses the solutions of the sub problems to solve for the original problem. Enter desired values, weights and knapsack capacity in the main function and the program will return the number of operations taken for both the dynamic and non dynamic instance. It will also display the knapsack table and will return both the optimal items to select and the value that selecting these items will produce. The program will also give information about the performance of the dynamic algorithm with respect to its non dynamic counterpart.
